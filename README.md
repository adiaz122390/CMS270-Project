# CMS270-Project

This project was a semester long group project for my Object Oriented Design class. The class focused on Object Oriented principals and good design practices. The goal of the project was to model a business. We chose to model an online business that would sell custom shoes. The object oriented nature of the project had us code each of the shoe components as a class.
